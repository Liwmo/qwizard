			<h2>How does it work?</h2>
			<p>
				Try to do your best on quizzes to accumulate as many points as possible. Scores will be kept weekly and monthly, and there will be prizes awarded based on scores from time to time.  The method for determining who wins a prize will be communicated at the time the prize is announced.

			<h2>I hear there are prizes!</h2>
			<p>
				Prizes based on quiz results will be announced periodically.  The better you do on the quiz, the more likely you are to win!
